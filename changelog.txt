v0.3.6

- Stalacs can now stalk and ambush villagers.
- Jackies have a new animation when struck.
- Jackies now light up when aggro.
- Added a special bow as an easter egg. `/function zombies_evolved:_/give_bow_toy` can be used to obtain it. When fired at earthy ceilings, it can mimic the 'stalac trap' ability.
