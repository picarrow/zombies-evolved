# Zombies Evolved v1.0.0

## ðŸŸ§ About
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zombies Evolved is a data pack that seeks to provide players with a uniquely arduous challenge while also maintaining Minecraft's beloved feel and freedom.
Each zombie variant added is intended to bring along new mechanics and a refreshing ambience of horror.
As of the current version, there are three new zombie variants added to the game.

## ðŸŸ§ Installation
***It is recommended that a stable version from [Releases](https://github.com/picarrow/zombies-evolved/releases) is installed.***

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Zombies Evolved data pack should be installed like any other data pack.
That entails dragging the entire pack (the ZIP) into the `datapacks` folder of a world.
Additionally, Zombies Evolved requires the data-pack library [Hit Match](https://github.com/picarrow/hit-match/releases) to be installed along with it.
The compatible versions of Hit Match are listed in the description of each release.
